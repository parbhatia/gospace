# go space

### this project is currently usable
### to view a reasonable demo, run dev scripts on both backend and frontend folders:

```
cd backend
npm run dev

cd frontend 
npm run dev

navigate to http://localhost:3000 for frontend

because of self generated ssl certs, you might have to navigate to https://localhost:4000 and make sure it's not being blocked by the browser
```

### to do: 
##### (in order of importance, kinda)
- [ ] add functionality to select devices
- [ ] producer video/audio feed should be in the corner of the screen, and hideable
- [ ] audio to text translation 
- [ ] dockerize frontend and backend
- [ ] auto room name generator, like "shivering mountain" or "volcanic ash" idk
- [X] data producers and data consumers pause functionality?
- [ ] css TV on/off animation
- [ ] finishing implementing debug module instead of console logs
- [X] add room elapsed time
