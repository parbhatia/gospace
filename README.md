<p style="margin-bottom:0" align='center'>
Video, audio, and canvas sharing app using WebRTC, Socket.io, React.js, and Node.js
</p>

## Features

- **SFU** — Instead of using a P2P mesh network, where all peers are streaming data to each other, a SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) is used as a proxy to forward data between each other. An SFU enables communication connections that far exceed regular P2P mesh networks in terms of bandwidth optimization.

- **Frontend** — Created using Typescript, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Mediasoup Client](https://mediasoup.org/documentation/v3/mediasoup-client/), [Socket.io](https://socket.io/), and [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/). Enables sharing of audio, cideo, and data sharing of up to 400 concurrent users (one _healthy_ backend server's CPU limit). Currently, only data related to coordinates of html canvas is being shared.

- **Backend API** — Created using Typescript, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Socket.io](https://socket.io/), [Mediasoup](https://mediasoup.org/documentation/v3/mediasoup/design/).

## Plans / To do

##### (in order of importance, kinda)

- [ ] add functionality to select devices
- [ ] put .d types in correct folder
- [ ] producer video/audio feed should be in the corner of the screen, and hideable
- [ ] audio to text translation
- [ ] dockerize frontend and backend
- [ ] sandbox to https://gospace.me
- [ ] auto room name generator, like "shivering mountain" or "volcanic ash" idk
- [x] data producers and data consumers pause functionality?
- [ ] css TV on/off animation
- [ ] finishing implementing debug module instead of console logs
- [x] add room elapsed time

## Quickstart

```
cd backend
npm run dev

cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 for frontend

Because of self generated ssl certs, you might have to navigate to https://localhost:4000 and make sure it (the backend) is not being blocked by the browser, as it most likely is.
